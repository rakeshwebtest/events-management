# events-management

To set up your system for development with Angular 16, Python with Django (latest version), and other tools like GitHub and VSCode, you'll need to ensure your environment meets certain requirements. Here's a guide:

### System Requirements:

1. **Operating System**: This setup should work on Windows, macOS, or Linux distributions.

2. **Node.js and npm**: Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

3. **Python**: Django is based on Python, so you need to have Python installed. Download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to install Python version 3.x.

4. **Angular CLI**: You'll need Angular CLI to create and manage Angular projects. Install Angular CLI globally using npm:
   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli@16
   ```

5. **Django**: Install Django using pip, Python's package installer:
   ```
   pip install django
   ```

6. **Git**: Install Git for version control. Download and install Git from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

7. **GitHub Account**: Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one already: [GitHub](https://github.com/).

8. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: VSCode is a popular code editor. Download and install VSCode from the official website: [VSCode Downloads](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Angular Setup**:
   - Create a new Angular project using Angular CLI:
     ```
     ng new event-management-system --version=16
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd event-management-system
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```
     ng serve
     ```

2. **Django Setup**:
   - Create a new Django project:
     ```
     django-admin startproject event_management
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd event_management
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

3. **GitHub Setup**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Initialize your local project directory as a Git repository:
     ```
     git init
     ```
   - Add your remote repository URL:
     ```
     git remote add origin <repository_url>
     ```
   - Commit your changes and push to GitHub:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push -u origin master
     ```

4. **VSCode Setup**:
   - Open VSCode and install any necessary extensions for Angular, Python, Git, etc.
   - Open your project folder in VSCode:
     ```
     code .
     ```

With these setup instructions, you should have a basic development environment ready for building your event management system using Angular 16, Python with Django (latest version), and other tools like GitHub and VSCode. Adjust the instructions as needed based on your project requirements and preferences.
